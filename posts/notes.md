## What’s next?

I added Storybook to the NextPizza project, although I’m still not sure if I really need it. The app uses a relatively small number of components and visual variations. To truly take advantage of Storybook’s potential, I should probably use it in a more ambitious project. But which one?

For now, I have one idea. I noticed that websites like _justjoin.it_ don’t have a dedicated mobile app, so I’m planning to build a recruitment app loosely inspired by their platform.

## Unit tests

I also added unit tests to the entire application using Vitest and Copilot — don’t worry, I understand what I’m pasting in.  
That said, if I had to write these tests completely from scratch by hand, it would definitely take me much more time, so I use AI tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT.

# Next Auth.ts

There are no issues with integrating authentication with providers like Google, GitHub, etc. However, I have a problem with implementing my own authentication using email and password. I would like to build this kind of authentication once and do it properly. Overall, I want to use this project as a reference for future projects, so it needs to be done in the best possible way.
